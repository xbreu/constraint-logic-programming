# Constraint Logic Programming

## Objectives

This course addresses the Logic Programming (LP) and Constraint Programming (CP) paradigms, specifically Constraint Logic Programming (CLP). The LP paradigm presents a declarative approach to programming, based on formal reasoning processes, more appropriate to the resolution of certain types of problems. CLP allows for an efficient approach to constraint satisfaction problems and optimization problems, modeling them in a direct and elegant manner.

## Learning outcomes and competences

At the end of this course, students should:
- Be familiar with declarative programming paradigms, namely LP and CLP.
- Identify classes of problems where LP and CLP are particularly relevant.
- Possess abstract reasoning skills and the ability to solve problems in a declarative manner.
- Be able to correctly apply LP and CLP techniques.
- Be able to build full Prolog applications, with and without constraints.
